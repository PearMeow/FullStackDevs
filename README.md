Project: Durak, a Russian card game where the first person to run out of cards wins. The deck is comprised of 6 to Ace for a total of 36 cards. Each player is dealt 6 cards at the start of the game. Then another card is drawn and that card's suit becomes the trump suit. The player with the lowest trump suit goes first and attacks. A player may attack by placing down a card or more with the same number. Cards can only beat their respective suits unless they are a trump suit. If the defender fails to beat all the cards, they take them all and lose their attacking turn. Each turn, players draw until they have 6. The game ends when one player runs out of cards.
